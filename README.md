### Problema - proyecto IV

I'm an Erasmus student who wasn't used to cooking or thinking about what to eat.
My problem is that I often have no idea what to cook or how to cook it, causing me 
to waste a lot of time looking for recipes I like, which is why I needed to create 
a meal plan for the whole week, so that I would know the shopping list in advance 
and the need to defrost something.

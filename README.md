### Problema - proyecto IV

I'm an Erasmus student who wasn't used to cooking or thinking about what to eat. 
My problem is that I often have no idea how to cook the recipes I was used to back home,which 
leads me to waste a lot of time looking for similar ones on the internet or asking my mum.
As a student, I need something practical and simple so I can concentrate on my studies, something 
where I just have to put in my food preferences and choose the recipes I like, creating a shopping 
list to make for the week, already knowing what I have at home, saving me even more time.
